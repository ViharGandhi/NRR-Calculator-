This is a NRR calacluator which helps us determine that how much overs we should restrict a certain team to be a certain postion or in how many overs we should chase the target and what will be the revised NRR 
I have made the algorihtm by majorliy using Binary search algorithm and finding the upper limit/upper bound meaning the max we can go so that we can reach the ceratin postion
